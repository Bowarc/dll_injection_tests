Next thing is to try to find a function that returns or receives some sort of canvas or draw pipeline that i can edit to draw on the screen, i belive that it's very rendering backend dependent..

I would also need to learn more about 'low level' rendering and how do it in uncontrolled environement (i.e. in the target process from it's memory)
